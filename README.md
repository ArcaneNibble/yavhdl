# Yet Another VHDL tool

This is yet another attempt to build an open-source VHDL (IEEE 1076-2008) tool
that performs parsing, semantic analysis, and elaboration. The goal is to at
some point in the future integrate this with the
[yosys](https://github.com/cliffordwolf/yosys) HDL synthesis tool.

## Current status
The initial parser is complete. Semantic analysis is being brainstormed.
